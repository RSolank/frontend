## 🏗️ 1. Architecture & Design Principles

To match the backend's **feature-based (screaming) architecture**, the frontend
should reorganise from a "by-technical-layer" tree
(`pages/`, `components/`, `state/`, `utils/`) into a "by-business-feature"
tree (`features/transactions/`, `features/budgets/`, ...) so the same vocabulary
lines up across the wire.

### Core rules

- **KISS / DRY** — same defaults as the backend; prefer obvious code over
  clever abstractions.
- **Feature isolation** — every feature owns its components, hooks, API calls,
  routes, and tests under `src/features/<feature>/`. No cross-feature reaches.
- **Dependency direction** — features depend on `shared/`; `shared/` never
  imports a feature.
- **Endpoint vocabulary follows the backend** — feature names mirror
  `backend/app/modules/` (auth, users, metadata, tags, beneficiaries,
  transactions, categorization, taxation, budgets).

### Platform target

The app is **web-first** for the current roadmap — the canonical
experience is a desktop browser. A native mobile app is a planned
future track (separate codebase / project), **not** part of this
refactor.

However, the web app must **resize gracefully so users opening it in
a phone or tablet browser can use it comfortably**. Concretely:

- No horizontal scrolling on `body` at any viewport ≥ 320 px.
- Every interactive control is reachable and large enough to tap
  (target ≥ 44 px on touch viewports).
- Tables and other data-dense surfaces degrade to a usable form on
  narrow viewports (horizontal scroll inside the surface, or a
  card/list fallback — the owning feature batch decides which fits
  its data).
- Modals, dropdowns, headers, and forms reflow rather than overflow.

The concrete breakpoint contract lives in
[`docs/conventions.md`](docs/conventions.md) "Visual design language →
Responsive design"; check every surface you build against it.

### Layering inside a feature

```text
api/         data access — queries.ts, mutations.ts, keys.ts, schemas.ts (TanStack Query)
hooks/       feature-specific React hooks built on top of `api/`
components/  UI primitives scoped to this feature
pages/       route-mounted screens; thin — orchestrate hooks + components
state/       Zustand stores scoped to this feature (only when state crosses pages)
*.routes.tsx route table (RouteObject[]) for this feature; consumed by `app/routes.tsx`
*.test.tsx   co-located component / hook / page tests (MSW for network)
```

## 🛠️ 3. Tooling & Workflow

### Required toolchain

- **Node**: any LTS that ships with the current Vite line.
- **Package manager**: npm (lockfile committed as `package-lock.json`).
- **Bundler / dev server**: Vite (`npm run dev`, default port 5173).
- **Language**: **TypeScript (strict)** — `noUncheckedIndexedAccess` on,
  `allowJs` on during the per-feature migration. Backend response types are
  generated from `/openapi.json` into `src/shared/types/api.ts` via
  `openapi-typescript`.
- **Lint / format**: **ESLint** (flat config) + **Prettier**. Plugins:
  `eslint-plugin-react`, `eslint-plugin-react-hooks`, `eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y`,
  `eslint-plugin-import` (with `no-restricted-paths` enforcing the
  features → shared dependency direction from §1).
  `prettier-plugin-tailwindcss` handles class-name ordering.
- **Server state**: **TanStack Query v5** — every feature exposes
  `useXyzQuery` / `useXyzMutation` hooks from its `api/`. Devtools enabled in
  dev. `staleTime` and invalidation strategy per-feature, not global.
- **Client state**: **Zustand** — provider-free stores under
  `features/<feature>/state/`. One store per domain (no god-store). `persist`
  middleware for tokens (see `useAuthStore`).
- **Forms**: **react-hook-form** + **Zod**. Zod schemas live in each feature's
  `api/` folder and double as the TS request-body type via `z.infer`.
- **Styling**: **Tailwind CSS v4** via `@tailwindcss/vite`. Shared component
  patterns extract into `@layer components` blocks; long classNames are
  Prettier-sorted, not extracted prematurely. _Future option: revisit
  vanilla-extract if the project scales to need typed, zero-runtime styles
  with formal theming._
- **Test runner**: Vitest, `happy-dom`, `@testing-library/react`.
- **Backend mocking in tests**: **MSW (Mock Service Worker)** — handlers live
  in `src/test/handlers/<feature>.ts`. Tests exercise the real React Query
  path; `vi.mock(apiClient)` is no longer the default pattern.
- **Routing**: `react-router-dom` v6.4+ **data router** —
  `createBrowserRouter` consumes per-feature `RouteObject[]` arrays from
  `features/<feature>/<feature>.routes.tsx`, composed in `app/routes.tsx`.
  Each `RouteObject` carries its own `errorElement` (see
  [`docs/architecture.md`](docs/architecture.md) → Error boundaries) and a
  `lazy: () => import(...)` for code-split first paint. _Future option:
  migration to TanStack Router is a separate adoption, not part of this
  refactor._
- **Bundle budget**: initial JS ≤ **125 KB gzipped**, CSS ≤ **15 KB gzipped**,
  checked via `size-limit` (`npm run size`). A ≤ **80 KB gzipped** per-feature
  lazy-chunk target is documented but not yet wired into `size-limit`. See
  _Code-quality gates_ below for the full gate contract.

### Commands

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev      # Vite dev server on :5173
npm run build    # production bundle
npm test         # vitest run (happy-dom env, single shot)
npx vitest       # vitest watch
npx vitest run src/features/auth/pages/LoginPage.test.jsx   # single file
```

`VITE_API_URL` overrides the API base (default `http://localhost:4000`).

### Code-quality gates (strict enforcement)

The maintainability board is **zero**: `npm run lint` must report **0 errors
and 0 warnings** before any branch merges (the merge gate is
`eslint --max-warnings 0`). Locked in Batch 10.12 — the current tree meets
every gate below, and **future work must not degrade it.**

**ESLint — error-level (a regression fails `npm run lint`):**

- `eslint-plugin-sonarjs` **recommended set**, at error severity. A few rules
  are explicitly disabled in `eslint.config.js` where they conflict with a
  codebase convention (e.g. the deliberate `void somePromise()` float marker);
  those exceptions carry an inline comment.
- **Complexity gates**, at the current thresholds (chosen a little above the
  worst legitimate offender): `complexity` ≤ **15**,
  `max-lines-per-function` ≤ **200** (skip blanks/comments), `max-depth` ≤
  **4**, `max-nested-callbacks` ≤ **4**, `max-params` ≤ **5**. Test files are
  exempt from the size/complexity gates (specs nest deeply by nature).
- **Ratchet rule.** These thresholds are a **ceiling, not a target** — tighten
  them over time, never loosen. A change that would need a number raised is a
  signal to refactor, not to bump the gate.

**No blanket suppressions.** Never suppress `complexity`,
`sonarjs/cognitive-complexity`, or `sonarjs/no-nested-conditional` — refactor
instead (extract a hook / helper / sub-component; see §6). An `eslint-disable`
is permitted only with an inline justification, and `max-lines-per-function`
may be suppressed only for a genuine flat shell (a mostly-JSX component with no
extractable logic).

**Bundle + coverage — enforced locally today; CI pipeline deferred:**

- **`size-limit`** (`npm run size`): initial JS ≤ 125 KB gz, CSS ≤ 15 KB gz.
  Current 123.35 KB JS / 11.84 KB CSS — **JS headroom is thin**, so keep new
  first-paint weight off the critical path (lazy-load per feature).
- **Coverage** (`npm run coverage`): **60%** global floor on statements /
  branches / functions / lines, enforced via vitest thresholds (currently
  passing: S 72 / B 64 / F 69 / L 74%). The **80% critical-path** target is
  **aspirational and not yet met** — it needs per-glob thresholds and is a
  tracked follow-up, not a current gate.
- Both run locally; promoting them to a build-failing CI pipeline is a tracked
  post-refactor follow-up (likely alongside the backend platform CI work).

## 🔒 4. Privacy, Security & Path Rules

### Absolute privacy of paths

- **No personal absolute paths** (e.g. `/home/...`, `/Users/...`) in source,
  comments, configs, or docs. Use relative paths from the project root.

### Browser-side security

- **Never log secrets** — `console.log(token)` in dev tools makes them visible
  in user devtools too. Strip access tokens from any debug log before
  committing.
- **No PII in URLs or query params** — keep `dob`/`contact` only inside POST
  bodies; the backend already filters them out of responses.
- **Sanitize HTML** anywhere `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` is used (currently
  nowhere — keep it that way unless there's a clear reason).
- **CSRF / cookies** — the backend issues a cookie + Bearer dual; the SPA
  uses Bearer + `localStorage` today. If that changes, audit every fetch
  call site.

### Dev/test environment

- `.env.local` for personal overrides (gitignored). Never commit a `.env`
  with real secrets.

---

## 📡 5. Data Fetching & Server State

### Current state (baseline)

`src/utils/apiClient.js` is a thin `fetch` wrapper used directly inside
`useEffect` blocks. Cache, retry, deduplication, and error normalisation are
all manual or absent.

### Target state

**TanStack Query v5** owns all server state. Each feature exposes
`useXyzQuery` / `useXyzMutation` hooks from its `api/` folder. Cache keys
are produced by a per-feature `keys.ts` factory (single source of truth for
invalidation). The cross-feature invalidation graph that motivates this
choice:

```text
useCreateTransactionMutation  → invalidates  ['transactions', 'budgets', ['taxation', 'current-week']]
useUpdateBudgetMutation       → invalidates  ['budgets', ['taxation', 'current-week']]
useCreateRuleMutation         → invalidates  ['categorization', 'rules']
```

Per-feature shape:

```text
features/<feature>/api/
├── queries.ts       # useXyzQuery hooks
├── mutations.ts     # useXyzMutation hooks
├── keys.ts          # cache-key factory
└── schemas.ts       # Zod schemas (request/response) → exported as TS types via z.infer
```

Rules:

- All API calls live in `src/features/<feature>/api/`. **Pages never call
  `fetch` directly.** A page imports a query/mutation hook and uses it.
- Underlying transport stays as `src/shared/api/apiClient.ts` (typed fetch
  wrapper with auth header + error normalisation). React Query's `queryFn`
  calls it.
- Response shapes are typed from `src/shared/types/api.ts` (generated from
  backend's `/openapi.json` via `openapi-typescript`). When in doubt about
  a shape, regenerate before guessing.

### User preferences contract (currency + timezone)

The backend's `UserPreferencesMiddleware`
([`backend/app/core/middleware.py`](../backend/app/core/middleware.py))
reads two headers from every incoming request and binds them to
`request.state.preferences` + a `ContextVar` that the service layer
queries via `get_current_preferences()`:

| Header | Default if absent | Source on frontend |
|---|---|---|
| `x-user-currency` | `USD` | `usePreferencesStore.currency` |
| `x-user-timezone` | `UTC` | `usePreferencesStore.timezone` |

**The frontend is responsible for sending both on every authenticated
request** so the backend's timezone-sensitive logic and currency-aware
formatting see the user's real preferences rather than the defaults.

**Where the values come from:**

- After login (and after token refresh / profile save), the auth flow
  calls `GET /api/users/preferences` — returns
  `{currency, country, timezone}` (currency/country from the profile row,
  timezone resolved by the middleware from the country lookup).
- The response populates `usePreferencesStore` (Zustand, in
  `src/shared/state/preferences.store.ts` — **must live in `shared/`
  because `shared/api/apiClient.ts` reads from it; `shared/` cannot
  depend on `features/`**).
- `apiClient.ts` injects both headers on every request, reading from the
  store on each call.

**Rules every batch must follow:**

- **No raw amount formatting.** Every user-facing amount goes through
  `shared/utils/currency.ts → formatMoney(amount, code, symbol)`. The
  helper renders `${symbol}${amount}` when a symbol is available and
  falls back to `${code} ${amount}` when it isn't. Never use
  `(amount).toLocaleString()` directly in a component — that drops the
  currency entirely.
- **No raw date formatting.** Every user-facing date/time goes through
  `shared/utils/dateUtils.ts` helpers, which take the active timezone
  from the store and pass it to `Intl.DateTimeFormat` via the
  `timeZone` option. Never call `new Date(iso).toLocaleDateString()`
  in a component.
- **No UTC-derived "today" defaults in forms.** `new Date().toISOString().split('T')[0]`
  is wrong for users east of UTC after ~6 PM local. Use
  `todayInUserTz(tz)` from `dateUtils` for default date-input values.
- **Form submission converts back.** Date inputs are interpreted in the
  user's tz; `localToUtcIso(localDateString, tz)` produces the ISO
  string sent to the backend.
- **Currency dropdowns show both code and symbol.** `${code} (${symbol})`
  format in `<CurrencySelect />` so users recognise either notation.
  When `symbol` is null, render just `${code}`.

---

## 🧩 6. Component Design

- **Pages are thin** — they orchestrate feature hooks + components; they
  should not own significant logic.
- **Components are pure when possible** — receive everything they need via
  props; if they need data, take it from a hook the page passes down or
  call a feature hook themselves.
- **Co-locate tests** next to the component being tested: `Foo.tsx` and
  `Foo.test.tsx` in the same folder. Vitest picks them up automatically.
- **Avoid prop drilling beyond 2 levels** — promote to a feature-level
  context or a hook that does the lookup.
- **Accessibility** — every interactive element keyboard-reachable; labels
  on every input; semantic HTML over `<div onClick>`.

### View-model hook extraction

When a component accumulates state + effects + handlers, **extract a
`useXxx()` view-model hook** that owns that logic and return a thin render
from the component. Split distinct field-groups, list rows, and overlays
into their own presentational sub-components. This is the canonical move for
keeping a component under the §3 complexity / `max-lines` gates — reach for it
*before* a suppression.

This is the pattern used throughout the codebase — e.g. `useRegisterForm`,
`useAddTransactionForm`, `useGenerateBills`, `useAccountSecurity`,
`useExpenseTrackerView`; and presentational splits like the `RecoveryFlow`
per-step components, `MerchantFields` / `PersonFields`, `BeneficiaryTable`,
and `DateCalendarPopup`. Match it for new work.

### Component patterns

The full catalogue of UI/component patterns to follow when building a
surface — the visual design language, the Modal / SearchableList /
Searchable-dropdown / DetailModal patterns, the Remove-in-edit and
row-highlight conventions, the accessibility-vs-preferences split, and the
ISO week convention — lives in **[`docs/conventions.md`](docs/conventions.md)**.
Read it before adding or changing a feature surface.

---

## 🧪 7. Testing

### Layout

- Co-locate `*.test.tsx` next to the component it tests. Vitest auto-discovers.
- Cross-cutting smoke tests (router rendering, providers compose) live in
  `src/app/` next to the shell.
- Shared test infrastructure (MSW handlers, render helpers, fixtures) lives
  under `src/test/` (singular). This is the **only** sanctioned non-colocated
  test location.
- A top-level `tests/` directory mirroring the backend layout is **not**
  used — colocation is required by the feature-isolation rule in §1.

### Test-on-touch

Any thinly-tested or untested file you modify gets a colocated
characterization test added **in the same change** — and write it _before_
you refactor, so it pins current behavior and catches regressions the
refactor might introduce. (This is how the refactor surfaced and fixed the
reference-data money-symbol race.) New features ship with their tests; never
"tests later".

### Coverage targets

- **Enforced floor (gate):** **60%** global on statements / branches /
  functions / lines, via vitest thresholds (`npm run coverage`); reports go to
  `coverage/`. Currently passing (S 72 / B 64 / F 69 / L 74%).
- **Aspirational (not yet met):** **80% lines** on critical-path pages (auth,
  transactions create/edit, budgets create, taxation bills view). Reaching it
  needs per-glob thresholds and is a tracked follow-up, **not** a current
  gate — see §3 _Code-quality gates_.

### Mocking the backend

- **MSW** is the default. Handlers live in `src/test/handlers/<feature>.ts`
  and are composed in `src/test/server.ts`. `setupTests.ts` starts/stops the
  server with `beforeAll` / `afterAll` and resets between tests.
- React Query hooks run their full code path — cache, retry, error mapping.
  This keeps tests refactor-proof: rewriting `api/queries.ts` doesn't break
  the test surface.
- `vi.mock(apiClient)` is reserved for the rare case where a test cares about
  a specific transport-level concern (e.g. retry policy). It is no longer the
  default pattern.

---

## ⚡ 8. Performance & UX

- **Defer expensive work** to `useMemo` / `useCallback` only when a measured
  regression exists — don't pre-optimise.
- **Code-split** at the feature boundary: `const Lazy = lazy(() => import('./LazyPage'))`.
- **Suspense + ErrorBoundary** at every feature route's entry.
- **Skeleton loaders** for any list fetch > 200 ms.

---

## 📚 9. Documentation

Mirrors the backend's `docs/` shape so contributors don't context-switch:

```text
docs/
├── architecture.md       # design, layering, routing, data-fetch story
├── modules/<feature>.md  # one page per feature mirroring backend module docs
├── testing.md            # test layout, fixtures, run commands
└── refactor/             # historical — implementation_plan.md etc.
```

Same per-batch update rule as backend: **every batch updates the docs as
its closing step.**
